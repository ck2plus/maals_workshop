# Maal's Workshop
A Place for Maal to store and keep track of commissions and requests.

The categories are based on the main focus of a project/request. All berber stuff in religion/berber, all generic martial society stuff in society/martial. And so on.

Place requests in Issues or ping me on discord.
If the issue is tagged "Question", it mean that I have done everything I can with the data given so far. Does it even need a CoA? An evil society? What would it be called and what sort of picture it'd need? And so on.
